# --- Files generated by Kustomize ---
# Although Kustomize sources are versioned, the direct output of 'kustomize build'
# is typically not committed to the repository in a GitOps flow, as Argo CD builds it in real-time.
# However, if you ever build locally and don't want the output committed, you can add:
# kustomize-build/ # Or the name of the directory where you save the build output

# --- Local configuration and environment files ---
# If you have sensitive value files that should not be committed, add them here.
# For example, if you use a 'values-secret.yaml' for local credentials:
# values-secret.yaml

# Development-specific environment files
.env
.flaskenv

# --- Credentials and secrets (if generated locally) ---
# Any file containing PATs, keys, or plaintext certificates.
# Ensure that the Base64 secret file *is* versioned if you manage it with Kustomize,
# but not the unencoded version if you generate it locally for .dockerconfigjson.
# For example, if the raw token were in a file:
# my_raw_pat.txt

# Files used to generate the .dockerconfigjson secret locally
dockerconfig.json
